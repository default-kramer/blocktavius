== Remember ==
NodeGroup (aka Owner) no longer matters for propagation algorithm.
It's just a "who wants to raise the PropertyChanged event" thing now.
And remember how the ChunkLayer and MinimapLayer own properties declared as I.Project.Whatever.

Changeset dispatch model:
* Explicit flush
* Auto flush (Dispatcher.BeginInvoke "if not flushed, flush" logic)

Should we relax the "only one changeset at a time" requirement?
It would really be just for unit testing I think.

Alternate approaches to custom type description?
* ProjectVM : BaseVM<ProjectKernel>

Possible footgun? You request a change but read the value before applying the changeset.

Anything we can do about collections?
Auto-disconnect when removed?
Wait for a concrete use case.

Logging!



== Wins ==
Being able to diagram the DAG is great.

Changing a Derived Element to an Async Derived Element without any other code being aware.

Race conditions pretty much eliminated. (Auto discard results from stale input)
